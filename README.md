# OfficeFileTypeUpdate
Contains a couple macro/vba enabled documents to convert old Office file formats to newer formats (*.doc -> *.docx, etc)

Instructions:
* Open the file
* Press ALT+F11 to open the VBA screen
* View the code and change any variables at the top
* Press F5 to run it.

Test it on a COPY of a small subset of your files before going all crazy.
