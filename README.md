# OfficeFileTypeUpdate
Contains a couple macro/vba enabled documents to convert old Office file formats to newer formats (*.doc -> *.docx, etc).  Each file has quick instrucitons within it when you open them.  If you have a lot of files you will need to have a 64-bit version of Office installed, especially for Visio.

Instructions:
* Open the file
* Press ALT+F11 to open the VBA screen
* View the code and change any variables at the top
* Press F5 to run it.

Test it on a COPY of a small subset of your files before going all crazy.

Note: The converter for word is a little goofy due to some security settings but the document explains what to do once you open it.
